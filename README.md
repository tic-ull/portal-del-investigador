# Portal del Investigador

*Portal del Investigador* is a project promoted by the Service of Information
Technology and Communications (STIC) at University of La Laguna (ULL) which 
aims to centralize the management of scientific activities and production of the 
University researchers.
   
## CORE: Centralized Management Module

Application that contains the basic set of essential tools for the proper
operation of other modules or applications of the project.

## CVN: Normalized Curriculum Vitae Management Module

This application relies on the CVN project of the *Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la 
Tecnología* (FECYT) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness 
(MINECO).

A Normalized Curriculum Vitae (CVN-PDF) is a PDF file with embedded 
CVN-XML technology, so that standardized information can be extracted for 
further processing. This extraction is the main feature of this module, but it also can import/export CVs.
